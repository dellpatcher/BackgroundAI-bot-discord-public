# ü§ñ BackgroundAI Bot  
**Version:** 0.2.0-alpha  

---

## üß© Overview
**BackgroundAI** is a multi-model **AI wrapper** that connects a Discord bot (Python) to a PowerShell-based AI engine powered by **Ollama**.  
It combines **three AI models** into one unified personality ‚Äî **NightshadeAI** ‚Äî by fusing reasoning, creativity, and summarization into a single response.

This project is currently in **alpha**, so expect limited functionality and active development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Discord Frontend (Python)
- Built with **discord.py**  
- Handles messages, mentions, and `/start` command  
- Sends user prompts to the PowerShell AI engine  
- Cleans and splits long replies to fit Discord‚Äôs 2000-character limit  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ PowerShell AI Orchestrator
- Receives the prompt from the Python bot  
- Runs **multiple Ollama models** in sequence  
- Cleans and merges their outputs into unified text  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Summarizer Layer
- A final model refines all drafts into one coherent, human-readable message  
- Acts as the ‚Äúeditor‚Äù that defines NightshadeAI‚Äôs final tone and style
